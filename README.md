# Sentiment_Analysis_Thai_Airport

This project was done to analyze the quality of Thailand's 2 airports namely Suvarnabhumi and Don Mueang by collecting data on England's 2 airports namely Manchester and London Heathrow to train the NLP model and test the result of the quality of Thailand's airports. The project was part of my Natural Language Processing class in 2022 and I repost this project again.

### Scraping
I got the airport's data about comments and the satisfied score from 2 sources namely Airlinequality and Trustpilot. Please check the method of scraping the data at code/scraping.ipynb

### Training and testing
After I got the airport's data, it was time to train the data and measure the accuracy of testing data. Please check the training and testing at code/sentiment_train_and_result.ipynb
